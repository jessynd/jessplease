			<p>Aurora Darwin currently resides in Toronto, but spent her formative years in South East Asia. During her childhood, she was unwittingly influenced by the forms of high-rise concrete structures and contrasting tropical forests.</p>
			<p>These opposing elements later manifested themselves in Aurora’s work at Sheridan College, where she discovered glass, a medium which was malleable enough to depict both the strength and structure of cities and the serenity and power of nature.</p>
			<p>Aurora Darwin was awarded the 2011 Sheridan College Summer Scholarship to attend the Pilchuk Glass School in Seattle, Washington. Aurora also received recognition of outstanding achievement in the Craft and Design- Glass program for being a member of the team that produced the Water Shed Awards. As well as having shown her work at the Ontario Crafts Council Gallery and The royal Botanical Gardens Aurora's work have also been donated to several relief funds including The Canadian Foundation for the Children of Haiti and Design Hope </p>
			<p>Aurora continues to develop her craft in the studio, focusing on architectural sculpture.</p>
