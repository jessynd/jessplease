				<p>The sand casting process begins by preparing a bed of sand. Then, a mold is pressed into the sand mixture to create a negative impression of the desired shape. Coloured glass powders and frits are added to the mold to color the resulting sculpture. A clean steel ladle is used to gather molten glass at a temperature where it runs freely. (Often a higher temperature than what is used to blow glass).</p>

				<p>After gathering the glass the strings of glass, which hang to the ladle, should be immediately cut with sheers.</p>

				<p>When the mold is filled with hot glass it is time to take the piece to the annealer (a large oven) The glass stays in the annealer long enough to slowly return to room temperature. This time in the annealer can range from a matter of hours to a number of days depending on the size and shape of the piece.</p>

			<p>After the piece has been annealed, loose sand can be removed from the glass surface by using a wire brush.</p>

					<p>The final stage of the piece is then cold worked using a grinder, or cut with a diamond saw, engraved or sandblasted.</p>
